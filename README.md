# Time Series Analysis 📈
A project for analyzing time series data using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand the structure and properties of time series data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Apply decomposition, differencing, and autocorrelation techniques.
- Use models like ARIMA for forecasting future values.

## 📁 Contents
- `Time Series Analysis.ipynb`: A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook covering:
  - Visualization of time series
  - Rolling statistics and ADF test for stationarity
  - Time series decomposition
  - ACF and PACF plots
  - ARIMA modeling
  - Forecasting and evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
